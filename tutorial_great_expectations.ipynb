    "# Great Expectations tutorial\n",
    "Welcome! In this tutorial we'll have a look at Great Expectations, a tool written and configured in Python that aids you in keeping an eye on your data quality. It provides a batteries-included solution for testing and documenting your data, so that nobody has to run into any surprises when consuming it. To achieve this, you create _expectation suites_. You can think of them as unit tests, but for data. They also double as documentation for your dataset, so that you won't have to repeat yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we mean by data quality? Well, bad quality data can happen for different reasons. Usually, data has bad quality if its structure (for example the columns and their types in a table) or its contents (specific cells in a table) are not what you expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more background on Great Expectations and the problems it solves, we can recommend the authors' blogpost: [Down with Pipeline debt / Introducing Great Expectations](https://medium.com/@expectgreatdata/down-with-pipeline-debt-introducing-great-expectations-862ddc46782a). It's a good read!\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src='figures/in_out.png' width=800px>\n",
    "\n",
    "Great Expectations can be used with your existing data assets - it is able to use different backends such as SQL databases, Spark clusters, or just your plain old filesystem. It will execute your expectation suites on these backends, and generate reports on the results of your validation.  \n",
    "Writing your expectation suite is usually done through Jupyter notebooks, so you'll feel at home. This notebook itself would be an example of how that works!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## In this tutorial\n",
    "We'll give you a brief introduction to the main concepts used in Great Expectations, walking you through writing your first expectations and generating your first data report. We have added many references to the official documentation that you can reference to when you are configuring your own setup.\n",

    "Once you created your suite using `great_expectations suite new`, you can use the `great_expectations suite edit` command to open up an auto-generated notebook that you can use to set up your suite. You should be able to recognise the structure of the first part of this notebook a bit ;-)\n",

    "The [getting started guide](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/en/latest/guides/tutorials/getting_started.html) can  help you along the way.

    "Just to recap, in this tutorial notebook, we started by giving you an overview of the tool and its purpose. We then showed you how to get started with the Python library and define your expectations. We saw that expectations can be bundled as suites, which can be used with validation operators to produce validation results. We had a look at data docs, a clean way to visualize your results and data documentation. We then dived into the data context, showing how the tool is configured. We had a look at checkpoints, which allow you to automate your data testing. We talked a bit about profiling, an experimental feature to generate expectations from given data. Finally, we introduced you to the CLI and set you on the right path to start using Great Expectations right away!\n",

    "We hope you enjoyed the tutorial and wish you all the best in using Great Expectations with your projects!\n",
